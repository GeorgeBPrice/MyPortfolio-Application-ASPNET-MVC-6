# MyPortfolio-Application-ASPNET-MVC-6

My Portfolio Website Application

This project was conceived as a way to demonstrate my foundational knowledge and skills in the .NET framework, and deployment into the Azure cloud.

Additionally demonstrated in this portfolio website is the use of technologies and languages such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, MVC Core 6, SMTP, and ReCAPTCHA antispam.

The brief for my portfolio was to design and build a website showcasing my resume to potential employers, my programming skills and knowledge, web development experience, and several projects I have on GitHub.
